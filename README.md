# singlesentence
The SingleSentence project is a social review platform written in React that allows users to review anything they wish to with one sentence. These reviews are collected into a simple and intuitive interface where users can browse reviews to get an idea of how a topic is perceived, learn about the topic or just for plain amusement.

This project is purely for fun and learning React at this point (and possible PWAs too depending on far I get!)
